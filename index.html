        <p> Hello there! My name is Aaron Koffel. I am a 27 year old bartender 
            and cook at Clodfelter's Public House. I am also a student studying Computer Systems. 
            I grew up in Beaverton, Oregon and have lived here in Oregon all my life. I moved to Corvallis in 2014 
            originally to study business. After changing degrees 3 times, I have finally settled on CS I was always a shy person, 
            and only kept a handful of close friends. Nowadays, I am much more social and open about myself. 
            I am a technology geek and gamer, and I look forward to sharing some of my favorite links with you below:
