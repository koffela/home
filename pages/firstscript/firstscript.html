        <p class = "item"><strong>Computer Science</strong> is the study of algorithms and processes that interact with data, that can also be expressed as data in the form of programs.
        Algorithms can store, manipulate and communicate information to a user. A Computer Scientist studies the theory of computation and practices designing software systems. Any program 
      can be written in three control structures:<br></br> <strong>Sequential</strong> is the default control structure, where instructions are executed line by line in the order of which they appear.
    <strong>Selection</strong> contains three main types of statements which are "if", "if/else" and "switch". Both "if" and "if/else" statements can be nested. Switch statements are used
  when there are multiple cases to choose from. Lastly, <strong>Iteration</strong> also known as repitition, repeatedly executes a series of statements while a condition is true. "While", "do/while",
 and "for" loops are the three main types of iteration. A loop can be either controlled by an event, or by a counter.</p>
