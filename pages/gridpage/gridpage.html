        <p class = "item"><strong>Chassis (case)</strong></p>
        <img class = "center" src="images/case.jpg" alt="PC Case">
        <p>The <strong>Chassis</strong> of the computer contains all of the main
        components of the computer including the motherboard, CPU, RAM, Power Supply,
        and hard drive.</p>
        <p class = "item"><strong>Motherboard</strong></p>
        <img class = "center" src="images/mobo.jpg" alt="MSI Motherboard">
        <p>The <strong>Motherboard</strong> is the computer's main circuit board. The motherboard is
        a thin plate that holds your CPU, RAM and peripheral cards as well as being able to connect hard drives and optical drives.
        The motherboard connects directly or indirectly to every part of the computer.</p>
        <p class = "item"><strong>Power Supply</strong></p>
        <img class = "center" src="images/power.jpg" alt="Power Supply">
        <p>The <strong>Power Supply</strong> is a piece of hardware that's used to convert the power
        provided from your outlet into useable power for the parts inside the computer case. 
    The PSU converts alternating current (AC) into a continuous form of power that the components use, called direct
    current (DC).</p>
        <p class = "item"><strong>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</strong></p>
        <img class = "center" src="images/cpu.jpg" alt="Intel CPU">
        The <strong>Central Processing Unit</strong> also known as the processor or CPU is located centrally on the
        motherboard of your PC. The CPU is known as the 'brain' of your PC, and its job is to carry out commands given
        to it by the user. The CPU is usually a two-inch ceramic square with a silicon chip inside. The CPU is typically covered
        by a <strong>heatsink</strong> which is an object that absorbs heat from the CPU and disperses it. A processor's speed is measured
        in megahertz (MHz) and gigahertz (GHz). A faster processor can execute instructions more quickly.
        <p class = "item"><strong>Random Access Memory (RAM)</strong></p>
        <img class = "center" src="images/ram.jpg" alt="RAM">
        <p><strong>RAM</strong> is your computer's short term memory. Here, your computer stores information from programs until it is needed.
        Short term memory is lost when the computer is turned off, therefore, you'll need to save any work you're currently working on, or lose it.
        RAM is measured these days in gigabytes (GB). The more RAM you have in your computerm the more things the computer can do at one time.</p>
        <p class = "item"><strong>Hard Drive</strong></p>
        <img class = "center" src="images/hd.jpg" alt="Hard Drive Seagate Barracuda">
        <p>A <strong>Hard Drive</strong> is where your software, documents, other files are stored. Your Hard Drive stores things in long term memory
        and so they are not lost when you turn off your PC. When you run a program or file, the hard drives copies some files into RAM so that they can be accessed
        more quickly. When you save, the data in RAM is copied back to the hard drive.</p>
        <p class = "item"><strong>Optional: Solid State Drive</strong></p>
        <img class = "center" src="images/ssd.jpg" alt="Solid State Drive">
        <p>A <strong>Solid State Drive</strong> is a solid-state storage device that uses integrated circuit assemblies as memory to store data persistently. SSD's have
        no mechanical components, and are MUCH faster than a traditional hard drive. </p>
        <p class = "item"><strong>Optional: Peripheral Cards</strong></p>
        <img class = "center" src="images/gpu.jpg" alt="Graphics Card GTX 1080">
        <p>Several peripheral cards exist to expand the capability of your computer, but the most common are <strong>Graphics Cards</strong>
        Which are responsible for what you see on your monitor. If you like playing games, or rendering high quality video, you can add a discrete graphics card to improve performance.</p>
        <p class = "item"><strong>Optional: Extra Cooling Solutions</strong></p>
        <img class = "center" src="images/cool.jpg" alt="PC Water Cooling">
        <p>Extra cooling solutions exist such as water cooling, additional fans, and air cooling. I suggest taking some time to do your own research on these if you wish to build a high-performance machine.</p>
