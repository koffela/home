        begin your journey as a programmer by introducing you to classic programs such as "Hello World" and "Guess My Number".<br><br> <strong>Beginner's Physics</strong>
         which will cover Kinematics (the study of motion without regard to its causes), and Dynamics (study of motion and forces that affect it).<br><br>
        Finally, we have <strong>Introductory Chemistry</strong> which will work with students both in and out of the lab on subjects such as Matter, Bonding, Energy, and Reactions.<br><br>
        For our younger students, we have our award-winning <strong>Little Science</strong> which is a class which works with kids 7-12 and teaches them about the different states of Matter, The Earth, Light, Cells, and Space.
