        <p class = "intro"><strong>Spectre Squadron (SPSQ)</strong> is a small, close-knit group of CMDRs (players) who play Elite: Dangerous. Spectre Squadron is made up of a diverse
          group of CMDRs from all over the world. Originally intended as a group (guild) where everyone would get a say, Spectre has since grown into a multiplatform 
          group, with many commanders on Xbox One, PC, and the Playstation 4. Spectre has existed for over three years since I personally created it, and continues to be 
          a positive influence in the galaxy. Spectre's primary mission is to defend human territories and assist newer players, to give them the skills they need to 
          survive in the depths of space. Space is a dangerous place... Recently, Spectre has been tracking the deadly 'Thargoid' aliens and engaging them in our territory. We look forward to later 
          in 2019, as we are collectively saving our money for a fleet carrier.</p></div>
